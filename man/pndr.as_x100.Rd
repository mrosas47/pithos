\alias{pndr.as_x100}
\title{Scale a value to a percentage-like factor of another total}
\usage{
pndr.as_x100(x, t, d = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of values to scale.}

\item{t}{Numeric scalar or vector representing the total or denominator.
Must be of compatible length with `x` (recycled if length 1).}

\item{d}{Integer; number of decimal digits to round to (default `2`).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as `x`, representing the scaled
value as `x * 100 / t`, rounded to `d` digits.
}
\description{
Computes a normalized percentage-style value by multiplying `x` by 100,
dividing by `t`, and rounding to `d` decimal places.
This is a compact helper to express values as “x per 100 of t”.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
pndr.as_x100(25, 200)    # → 12.5
pndr.as_x100(c(5, 10), 40, d = 1)
}
